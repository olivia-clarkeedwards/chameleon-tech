# Chameleon Tech Assessment 
A simple React app written in TypeScript and styled with Tailwind CSS.
Users can add items to three seperate shopping lists. 

## Notes
See commit history for working process. 
- Created brute force solutions for both logic and styling.
- Have done some refinement 

### Challenge 1: 
- Implemented single list to check the logic of using useState to store my lists in the browser
- Created object to store multiple lists 
- Created a component for each list and then combined these components into one component that displays a list card with an input for each supermarket. 
- Created a constant that holds the list of shops that need lists. Would be nice to add a feature to add new shops to this list. 


### Challenge 2: 
- Didn't have a go doing this but had a brief look at React DnD, a drag and drop technology which would provide a nice user experience for moving items from one list to another. 
- My inital brute force method was just to have an edit button that could move an item to a specified list from a drop down, perhaps?
